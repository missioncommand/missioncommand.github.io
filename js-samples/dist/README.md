# mil-sym-ts

## About

mil-sym-ts is an TypeScript port of the [Java-based MIL-STD rendering libraries](https://github.com/missioncommand/mil-sym-java) that have been used in US Army Mission Command software for years. In November 2013 Mission Command was given the approval to release and maintain these libraries as public open source. Eventually work on the MIL-STD-2525C SEC Renderer ended and the project was retired. 

This is a continuation of that effort and this library aims to support 2525D, 2525E and potentially more future versions.
